abstract = {The purpose of this article is to examine the relationship between developmental human resource (HR) practices and work engagement by focusing on the moderating role of service climate. Specifically, employee training opportunities, career developmental opportunities, and developmental performance appraisal were cast as the key dimensions of developmental HR practices. We used cross-sectional data with survey from 277 employees in six large banks in Pakistan. The results suggest that each of the dimensions of developmental HR practices was positively related to work engagement. Also, service climate was found to moderate the relationship between training opportunities and work engagement. Similarly, results showed that service climate moderated relationship between career developmental opportunities and work engagement. Regarding the practical implications, results suggest that policymakers should consider enriching HR factors by providing supportive environment, feedback and service climate to enhance employee engagement. In terms of originality, we contended that, to date, there is paucity of empirical study linking developmental HR practices to employees' work engagement. Hence, the present study addressed this gap by examining the relationship between developmental HR practices and work engagement, as well as the boundary condition on these relationships.},

abstract = {A review of empirical studies related to organizational and personality-related factors and the likelihood of employees engaging in deviant behaviour at work indicates that less attention has been paid to study the effects of organisational formal control on workplace deviance. Drawing upon the organisational control theory, this study examined Honesty-Humility as a boundary condition between organizational formal control and deviant workplace behaviour. Participants in the study consisted of 202 public sector employees from three Federal Polytechnics in northwestern Nigeria. As expected, results showed that organizational formal control had a significant negative relationship with workplace deviance. Most notably, we found that the effect of organizational formal control on workplace deviance was moderated by Honesty-Humility. The practical implication of this study is that organizations should conduct personality inventory tests prior to recruitment and selection, as the outcomes of the test could help managers select employees whose values are in line with organisational norms.},
