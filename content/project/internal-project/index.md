It is indisputable that small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) play a vital role in promoting economic growth of every country. In Brunei, SMEs make up 97% of all enterprises and contribute 22% of the country’ gross domestic product. While SMEs play a vital role in economic growth of Brunei, evidence suggests that they lack access to business development services (BDS), which could assist them to acquire key technical skills, improve their understanding of and access to markets, as well as to enhance their performance. To address this concern, we purposed to examine whether BDS could predict SME performance in Brunei Darussalam. Market access, management /organization, technology and product development, alternative financing mechanisms, as well as input and supply were casted as the components of BDS. The hypothesized model was tested and evaluated on a sample of 281 SMEs four major districts in Brunei using Partial Least Structural Equation modeling. Results indicated that input and supply, market access, technology and product development, and alternative financing mechanisms positively affect SME performance. However, management/organization was not found to be significantly related to SME performance.
