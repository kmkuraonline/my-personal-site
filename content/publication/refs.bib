abstract = {A review of empirical studies related to organizational and personality-related factors and the likelihood of employees engaging in deviant behaviour at work indicates that less attention has been paid to study the effects of organisational formal control on workplace deviance. Drawing upon the organisational control theory, this study examined Honesty-Humility as a boundary condition between organizational formal control and deviant workplace behaviour. Participants in the study consisted of 202 public sector employees from three Federal Polytechnics in northwestern Nigeria. As expected, results showed that organizational formal control had a significant negative relationship with workplace deviance. Most notably, we found that the effect of organizational formal control on workplace deviance was moderated by Honesty-Humility. The practical implication of this study is that organizations should conduct personality inventory tests prior to recruitment and selection, as the outcomes of the test could help managers select employees whose values are in line with organisational norms.},

Specifically, employee training opportunities, career developmental opportunities, and developmental performance appraisal were cast as the key dimensions of developmental HR practices. We used cross-sectional data with survey from 277 employees in six large banks in Pakistan. The results suggest that each of the dimensions of developmental HR practices was positively related to work engagement. Also, service climate was found to moderate the relationship between training opportunities and work engagement. Similarly, results showed that service climate moderated relationship between career developmental opportunities and work engagement. Regarding the practical implications, results suggest that policymakers should consider enriching HR factors by providing supportive environment, feedback and service climate to enhance employee engagement. In terms of originality, we contended that, to date, there is paucity of empirical study linking developmental HR practices to employees' work engagement. Hence, the present study addressed this gap by examining the relationship between developmental HR practices and work engagement, as well as the boundary condition on these relationships.},

The present study attempts to fill this void by testing the mediating role of ethical climate in the relationship between performance appraisal and organizational performance across 181 Nigerian public sector agencies. Cross-sectional mediation analyses were performed using partial least squares path modeling approach. Results indicated that performance appraisal was positively and significantly related to organizational performance. Regarding the mediating effect, ethical climate significantly mediated the relationship between performance appraisal and organizational performance. The study made recommendations and drew suggestions for future research to enhance the performance of public sector agencies.},

A web-based survey was used to collect data from 217 teaching staff from various higher education institutions in Nigeria. The data collected was analysed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) path modeling. As predicted, the path coefficient results supported the direct influence of perceived injunctive norms and self-regulatory efficacy on organisational deviance. Similarly, perceived injunctive norm and self-regulatory efficacy were found to be significant predictors of interpersonal deviance. On the contrary, perceived descriptive norms were not significant predictors of both organisational deviance and interpersonal deviance. In addition, self-regulatory efficacy does not moderate the relationship between perceived descriptive norms and organisational deviance. We also found support for the moderating role of self-regulatory efficacy on the relationship between perceived injunctive norms and dimensions of workplace deviance. The moderating role of self-regulatory efficacy on the relationship between perceived descriptive norms and interpersonal deviance was also supported. Finally, the policy implications of the study are discussed.},

abstract = {In the human setting, it has been shown that acute increase in the concentration of ketone bodies by infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate increased the cerebral blood flow (CBF) without affecting the overall cerebral metabolic activity. The mechanism by which this effect of ketone bodies was mediated is not known. Alterations in several parameters may possibly explain the increase in CBF and the resetting of the relation between CBF and cerebral metabolism. To study this phenomenon further, we measured global CBF and global cerebral metabolism with the Kety-Schmidt technique in the wakeful rat before and during infusion of ketone bodies. During acute hyperketonemia (average concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate: 6 mmol/L), global CBF increased 65{\%} from 108 to 178 mL/100 g min and the cerebral metabolic rates for both oxygen and glucose remained constant. This resetting of the relation between CBF and cerebral metabolism could not be explained by alterations in blood pH or arterial CO2 tension. By measuring cerebral intracellular pH by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, it could further be concluded that the brain pH was unchanged during acute hyperketonemia. These observations indicate that the mechanism responsible for the increase in CBF is rather a direct effect on the cerebral endothelium than via some metabolic interactions.},

abstract = {Prior research has indicated that employee turnover is detrimental to both individuals and organisations. Because a turnover intention in the workplace is detrimental, several factors have been suggested to better understand the reasons why employees may decide to leave their organisations. Some of the organizational-related factors that have been considered by previous research include perceived organizational justice, job satisfaction, perceived psychological contract breach, and perceived organizational support, among others. Despite these empirical studies, literatures indicate that less attention has been paid to the influence of perceived organisational politics, organizational trust, and perceived human resource practices management (HRM) practices on employee turnover. Hence, the present study fills in the gap by examining the relationship between perceived organisational politics, organizational trust, perceived human resource management practices and employee turnover among Registered Nurses in Nigerian public hospitals using multiple regression analysis technique. One hundred and seventy five Registered Nurses participated in the study. Result indicated that perceived organisational politics was significantly and positively related to turnover intentions. The result also showed that both organizational trust and perceived human resource practices were significantly and negatively related to turnover intentions. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.},

abstract = {Purpose – Drawing on social learning and self-efficacy theories, the purpose of this paper is to examine links among perceived workgroup norms, self-regulatory efficacy, and deviant workplace behaviours. Design/methodology/approach – Faculty members from universities located in the northwest geopolitical zone of Nigeria participated. Partial least squares path modelling tested moderation of self-regulatory efficacy on the relationship between perceived workgroup norms and deviant workplace behaviours. Findings – Findings suggest a positive relationship between perceived descriptive norms and deviant workplace behaviours. A hypothesised effect of perceived injunctive norms on deviant workplace behaviours was not supported. Results also suggest interaction terms representing perceived descriptive norms and self-regulatory efficacy are significant. Similar results regarding moderation of self-regulatory efficacy on the relationship between perceived injunctive norms and deviant workplace behaviours were found. Findings support the view that self-regulatory efficacy overrides predispositions individuals hold to engage in deviant workplace behaviours. Research limitations/implications – A cross-sectional design did not allow causal inferences, and self-report data associate with common method variance and social-desirability bias. Practical implications – Individual factors should be considered during selection in Nigerian universities. Moderation of self-regulatory efficacy suggests self-regulation minimises individual engagement in deviant acts. Thus, human resources managers in Nigerian universities should consider self-regulatory efficacy as a selection criterion when hiring academicians. This can be achieved by conducting personality inventory tests to screen those whose values are incompatible. Originality/value – Although extant research on organisational socialisation demonstrates mix findings regarding the link between perceived workgroup norms and deviant work behaviours, this study tests whether self-regulatory efficacy addresses these inconsistencies.},
