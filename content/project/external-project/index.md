This project examined the relationships between attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, moral obligation, and dishonest academic behaviours. Based on a sample of 255 polytechnics students in the Northwest Geopolitical zone of Nigeria, the results showed that attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control were positively related to dishonest academic behaviours. In addition, moral obligation was found to be significantly and negatively related to dishonest academic behaviours. It is recommended that management of polytechnics can minimize the incidences of dishonest academic behaviours by conducting personality inventory test during admission process to screen
out potential candidate whose values accord to that of their institution.
